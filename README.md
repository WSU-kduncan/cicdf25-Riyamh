## Projects 4 & 5

### In these projects we followed steps on how to complete the CI/CD workflow using GitHub, Docker, and AWS. Project 4 focuses on continuous integration where GitHub Actions builds a Docker image whenever a push is triggered. Project 5 focuses on continuous delivery/deployment where webhook listens on port 9000, pulls the latest image, and restarts the container.

- **README-CI.md** documents continuous integration. Can be found in cicdf25-Riyamh/[README-CI.md]. 
- **README-CD.md** documents continuous delivery/deployment. Can be found in cicdf25-Riyamh/Project-5/[README-CD.md].
